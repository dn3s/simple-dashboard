#Another of Many Simple Web Dashboards

It's even in PHP!

It was just supposed to be a way to monitor les.net account balance, but then I thought I may as well monitor server load, and then I thought I should make it easy to add more widgets.

It's very simple, cute, responsive, and simply cutely responsive. It probably won't look good in older browsers. Only tested in Firefox (latest stable). Also requires a unicode font or else some of the icons won't work.

Not recommended for internet-facing servers, at least until there's been more testing.

I will be adding more plugins!

##Installation

Just needs php (version 7 or a recent version of 5), and the `curl` extension.

Put it in a web-accessible directory. Move `config.sample.php` to `config.php` and edit it. Make sure your permissions are `700` or so, at least for your config since it has api keys and stuff in it. Also, make sure that your server respects `.htaccess` files, or configure your server manually to not serve up your config file or the `.git` directory. *This is very important, or else you will be serving up your config file, complete with API keys, to the public!*

##Plans For The Future

###Features

- Refactor the Widget system to reduce redundant code in widgets
- Caching of data cross-request, perhaps using CHDB or something similar, so that many users querying at once will not hammer upstream APIs
- Add a webfont. Also maybe a dedicated icon font so I'm not stuck trying to find appropriate symbols from obscure Unicode chars.

###Widgets

- Temperature, CPU usage, uptime. Also some small remote script and an option to pull from a remote host so that one can monitor a bunch of servers at once. This will require a widget format that allows supplying params from the config file, and will benefit from grouping (so you can group by host). This is what would make this actually useful to people.
- App/service specific stuff as the need arises. I probably won't add support for the app you're using unless I happen to be using it too. However it is very easy to make your own widget!

##Contributing

Take a look at `widgets/example.php` for a basic guide to making widgets. Each widget is a PHP class. Also check out `widgets/cmd.php` which makes it extremely easy to create widgets that use shell commands.
